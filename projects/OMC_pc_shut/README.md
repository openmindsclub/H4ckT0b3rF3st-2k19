This is a small project for my university club 'OpenMindsClub' to shutdown all the computer at once with a remote command, or after 8pm.

# How to install

- Run installer_client.sh on every machine
- Run installer_server.sh on the server machine

# How to use

To shutdown the computers just run : OMC_pc_server
